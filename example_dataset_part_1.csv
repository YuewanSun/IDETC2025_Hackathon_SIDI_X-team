rule_number,contentV.4.2.2,"Teams using modified lug bolts or custom designs must provide proof that Good Engineering
Practices have been followed in their design."V.4.3.3,"Tire Set
a. All four Dry Tires and Wheels or all four Wet Tires and Wheels do not have to be
identical.
b. Once each tire set has been presented for Technical Inspection, any tire compound or
size, or wheel type or size must not be changed."F.1.10,"Primary Structure
The combination of the following components:
• Front Bulkhead and Front Bulkhead Support
• Front Hoop, Main Hoop, Roll Hoop Braces and Supports
• Side Impact Structure
• (EV Only) Tractive System Protection and Rear Impact Protection
• Any Frame Members, guides, or supports that transfer load from the Driver Restraint
System"F.1.13,"Rollover Protection Envelope
The Primary Structure plus a plane from the top of the Main Hoop to the top of the Front
Hoop, plus a plane from the top of the Main Hoop to the rearmost Triangulated structural
tube, or monocoque equivalent.
* If there are no Triangulated Structural members aft of the Main Hoop, the Rollover
Protection Envelope ends at the rear plane of the Main Hoop"F.1.16,"Buckling Modulus (EI)
Equal to E*I, where E = modulus of Elasticity, and I = area moment of inertia about the
weakest axis."F.3.5.3,"Aluminum Tubing
a. Minimum Wall Thickness for Aluminum Tubing: Non Welded 2.0 mm
Welded 3.0 mm
b. Non Welded properties for aluminum alloy 6061-T6 for calculations in an SES must be:
Young’s Modulus (E) 69 GPa (10,000 ksi)
Yield Strength (Sy) 240 MPa (34.8 ksi)
Ultimate Strength (Su) 290 MPa (42.1 ksi)
c. Welded properties for aluminum alloy 6061-T6 for calculations in an SES must be:
Yield Strength (Sy) 115 MPa (16.7 ksi)
Ultimate Strength (Su) 175 MPa (25.4 ksi)
d. If welding is used on a regulated aluminum structure, the equivalent yield strength must
be considered in the “as welded” condition for the alloy used unless the team provides
detailed proof that the frame or component has been properly solution heat treated,
artificially aged, and not subject to heating during team manufacturing.
e. If aluminum was solution heat treated and age hardened to increase its strength after
welding, the team must supply evidence as to how the process was performed.
This includes, but is not limited to, the heat treating facility used, the process applied,
and the fixturing used.
